# Key Highlights:

-Performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand campaign performance metrics.

-Applied statistical hypothesis testing to evaluate differences between control and variant groups.

-Used libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for analysis and visualization.

-Concluded with data-driven insights and actionable recommendations to improve marketing strategies.
